                <h2>The Final Result</h2>
                <p> Air China CA923 stands out for receiving the highest score: 91.5665. Is it necessarily the best flight? What makes it better 
                    than CZ8309 (90.5)? If it is really the best flight, shall we all go for this flight when travelling between Shanghai and
                    Tokyo? But if it is not, what are our data and visualizations for? For these reasons, our final result is not to declare which
                    flight should be the first place, nor is it about any other calculations that might attribute to our flight tournament. Rather,
                    in this section we reflect on our methodology, provide a more reasonable interpretation of our data, and, most importantly,
                    discuss our thoughts on the epistemic function of data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though in round one and round two we filter off nearly half of our 23 candidates, the result of our tournament mostly comes from
                    the calculations in round 3. Grading the performance of each flights in multiple aspects is a seemingly effective way to make the 
                    incommensurable comparable. However, our grading criterias and the weights of each factors are not objective. Though we tried our
                    best, by referring to commensense, to adjust our grading criterias such that they can, in a sense, reflect how majority evaluates
                    each factors, it is impossible to make our grading criteria reliable and objective. Or, at least an objective and reliable grading
                    criteria is unattainable for us. Given that, our methodology should never be considered reliable. Instead, it is merely acceptable
                    and can be utilized in our project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Given that our methodology is not reliable and must be considered an expediency, what is the right way to interpret our data? We
                    contend that any proposition regarding our data must be conditional. For example, suppose we want to interpret the score of CA923,
                    the winner of our tournament. It makes no sense to say "CA923 is literally the best flight among all candidates. This is because
                    it receives the highest score." Rather, it must be conditional. That is, only "if a passenger really cares about punctuality, namely
                    the delay rate, he might want to consider CA923 for it receives the highest score under a grading criterias in which delay rate has
                    a weight of 34% in total" should be considered a reasonable interprtation of our data. And this sheds light on the purposiveness of
                    our data and visualizations. We contend that our data and visualizations, in this case, are not omnipotent. This is partly because
                    that at this point we are still unable to fully cultivate the potential of data. Instead, our data and visualizations are merely
                    supportive in a decision-making process. Our fighting tournament is, generally speaking, a decision-making process. And such process
                    happens everyday at everywhere. In short, decision-making process is ubiquitous and hence significant for our life. And what we demonstrate
                    is how data and visualizations might play a role in this important process. And our analysis shows us that our data and visualizations are
                    not decisive for an objective grading standard is unattainable at this point. Yet, our data is helpful and illuminating for it
                    presents a way by which we can rationally conduct a decision-making process to fulfil certain need or purpose.
