                <p>
                    We will have a flight tournament to figure out the most cost-effective flights between
                    Shanghai and Tokyo based on different potential factors. Within this competitive tournament, 
                    we will follow these steps:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Filter some flights based on objective data using visualizations</li>
                        <li>Score the remaining flights by a weighted formula</li>
                        <li>Figure out the most cost-effective flight</li>
                    </ol> 
                </p>
            </section>

                <h2>Let's focus on this route!</h2>
                <p>
                    The Shanghai to Tokyo route, a route connecting two metropolises in East Asia,
                    is one of the most popular flight routes in the world. This 3-hour, 1094-mile-length

                            the midnight to the evening.</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>

                <p>There is a bar chart below showing each airlines' flights' total seats amount for Shanghai - Tokyo route each day. All airlines are split into two group based on nations, and the total number of seats is depicted by the length of blue, horizontal bars. This plot as a whole demonstrates that Chinese airlines usually carry more passengers than Japanese airlines.</p>
                <iframe title="" aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-2iAaz" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/2iAaz/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="330" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}();</script>
                <p>From this chart, we got a few popular airlines such as China Eastern, Japan Airlines, Air China. However, the most popular one is not necessarily the best one, which is why we have designed this tournament.</p>
